		<div class="para-1">Banksy, the notorious anonymous British street artist has confirmed his pop-up work on his official Instagram, captioned - “Major new Basquiat show opens at the Barbican—a place that is normally very keen to clean any graffiti from its walls.”

			<div class="para-2">The night before the opening of a Jean-Michel Basquiat’s exhibition at the Barbican in London, two new Banksys appeared on the walls on the center.
			 <br><br>
			The works are perhaps a homage to the young artist who rose to fame in the late 1970s in the streets of NYC through his bold works referring to African history, slavery and colonialism. 
			<br><br>
			Banksy seems to be referencing the iconic Basquiat crown motifs and figures from Basquiat’s Boy and Dog in a Johnnypump (1982) to speak out about racial profiling while also challenging the Barbican’s strict graffiti removal policy.</div>
